SDL2_OpenGL3.3_Sample
=====================

SDL2_OpenGL3.3_Sample


##Installation

Linux development version (not tested on other plateforms but should work with minor fixes)

- Install Oculus SDK 0.3.2 and copy the `libovr.a` to `/usr/local/lib`
- Update your graphic card drivers (might need the proprietary drivers to work with the Oculus SDK), OpenGL 3.3
- Install SDL 2
- Make sure you have a valid C++ runtime (`libstdc++`) and a valid C++11 compiler (typically clang++/g++) (although C++11 features could be removed easily)


#Use

Type `make` and then `./main`.

There could be some warnings related to the Oculus SDK.
